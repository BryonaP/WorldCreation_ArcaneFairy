<h1> About Me </h1>


<img src="media/portrait1.jpeg" width = "40%">

<p> Hello! 
<br> My name is <b>Bryona Pelletier</b>, I am currently in my senior year at the University of Southern Maine, Majoring in Photography and Digital Design. <br> 
I wish to be able to express myself in many different ways by looking at different types of mediums and trying new things. <br> 
By doing what I do best and combining photography with different things that I try, such as virtual reality and 3D modeling,<br> 
I want to be able to show the world what kinds of things I can configure into something that means the world to myself, as an artist.
