<h2>Fairies Forest: World Creation</h2>
    
<p>
    This project is meant to express my personality and feelings into a world, <br>
    Understanding the significance between what I like and the community aspect of <br>
    how I am as a person is important. I wish for people to see what I enjoy as well as, <br> 
    Be able to help me improve and work more upon 3D Modeling. As I am new too this medium.
</p>

    <p>
    There are two seperate versions that I have created, including one with a voice over of an interview wth my VRChat Sister, Hexibus. <br>
    And another version without the voice over!
